<h2>Background</h2>


"One of the highlights of a long hot summer" -- <em>The Wire</em><br />
"Ludicrously straightfaced" -- <em>The Guardian</em><br />
"Freebie of the week" -- <em>Time Out</em><br />
"A far cry from Glastonbury or Reading" -- <em>New Statesman</em><br />
"the only way to understand the most communal musical gathering is to come along and plug in" -- <em>kultureflash</em><br />

<h3>Histoire</h3>
<p>
Le Placard started in 1998 in Paris, France.  At that time finding
venues for alternative music was difficult, and police raids on
unlicensed events were frequent.  So instead Erik Minkkinen organised
a headphone party in his small apartment, called 'placard' after the
French word for 'cupboard'.  
</p>
<p>Since then this concept has grown to an international streaming
festival, with tens of cities providing listening rooms for local and
remote performances.  Placard has formed part of the Mutek,
Transmediale, Garage and Pixelache festivals.  The event in Paris has
itself grown into an institution, running for 72 hours straight where
the audience sleep with their headphones on, still listening.

<h3>Placard UK</h3>

<p>The first UK Placard was in London in 2003, with its own
innovations including 20 minute quick-fire performances, organised by
a robot directing and switching between performers exactly to
schedule.  In this way 36 acts where squeezed into a 12 hour session
from midday until midnight.

Dallas Simpson, Motion, Yee-King, Sanso-Xtro, Si-Cut db and Janek
Schaeffer.
</p>

<p>
Many performers play with the headphone situation, for example by
passing microphones into the crowd without fear of feedback or using
the detailed, wide stereo field of headphones sometimes using binaural
(in-ear) microphones.

Distribution
</div>

<h3>Listening experience</h3>

<p>
Audio is powered by a bank of 16 headphone amplifiers, passively split
into 108 stereo outputs, distributed around the space via four
multicore cables.  Listeners choose between four sound levels by
picking a socket to match their headphone impedence.  Listeners bring
their own headphones, adaptors are provided for those with minijack
inputs.

<p>
With headphone cables everywhere, moving around the space becomes an
intra-audience performance art, part of the placard experience.
Wireless headphones have been considered but would spoil this
aesthetic, and also introduce practical problems with recharging
batteries.

<p>
A headphone listening room has a close atmosphere, the audience
directly connected to the music maker.  Listeners are often seen to
remove their headphones for a while to take in acoustic sounds of a
singer or instrument, or the quiet burbling of their neighbours'
headphones.
