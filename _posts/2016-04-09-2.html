Calum Gunn is slowly, inexorably hurtling towards death. Before that gruesome end, though, he's making frantic, indeterministic computer music with custom software that leaves behind contrails of broken rave, amateur FM synthesis and paranoid clattering. For EulerRoom, Calum will make a new multichannel work in which a computer tries vainly to fit rhythms into confined temporal spaces, leaving crunching, morphing bass tones to catch up.</p>

<a href="http://joannnne.github.io/">Joanne</a> is a Leeds-based improviser. Playing regularly in small venues
across the North, she is involved in various things. Joanne uses code
to play so she doesn’t have to.  Her EulerRoom performance will involve
objects and perhaps some motors.

<h3><a href="http://seancotterill.com/">coï¿¥ï¾¡pt</a></h3> coï¿¥ï¾¡pt is the
text-based musical alter-ego of <a href="http://seancotterill.com/">Sean Cotterill</a>, a digital
artist/tinkerer from Newcastle, UK. At EulerRoom he will present
quadraphonic meditative electronic improvisation with SuperDirt and
SuperCollider, going a bit wild at the end.

<h3><a href="http://yaxu.org/">Yaxu</a></h3>
<div class="label">Computer
Club</div> <a href="http://yaxu.org/">Yaxu</a> is the solo project of
EulerRoom resident Alex McLean, who makes all his music with
his handmade live coding
technology, describing complex musical patterns with simple
algorithmic structures. With any luck he'll launch
a <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/artists/yaxu">crowdfund
</a> for his next project at this very event, as well as taking
improvised, surround sound, broken algorithmic techno to the limit.
